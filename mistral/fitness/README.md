## Usage

### Run the AI Coach

```bash
node index.js
```

The system will:

1. ✅ Create a Mistral AI agent with coaching instructions
2. 📥 Fetch your last 2 weeks of training data from intervals.icu
3. 🧠 Analyze your training load, recovery metrics, and efficiency trends
4. 📝 Generate personalized coaching feedback
5. 📅 Post the analysis to today's calendar entry in intervals.icu

### Automation

You can automate daily coaching using either GitHub Actions (recommended) or local cron jobs:

#### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)

**Advantages**: Free hosting, reliable execution, no local machine dependency, version control integration.

1. **Create GitHub workflow file** `.github/workflows/daily-coaching.yml`:

```yaml
name: Daily AI Fitness Coaching

on:
  schedule:
    # Run every day at 8:00 AM UTC (adjust timezone as needed)
    - cron: "0 8 * * *"
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual trigger

jobs:
  coaching:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "18"

      - name: Install pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: latest

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      - name: Run AI Coaching
        env:
          MISTRAL_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MISTRAL_API_KEY }}
          ATHLETE_ID: ${{ secrets.ATHLETE_ID }}
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.INTERVALS_API_KEY }}
          DOWNLOAD_DIR: ./training
        run: node index.js
```

2. **Configure Repository Secrets**:

   Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions, then add:
   - `MISTRAL_API_KEY`: Your Mistral AI API key
   - `ATHLETE_ID`: Your intervals.icu athlete ID (e.g., `i123456`)
   - `INTERVALS_API_KEY`: Your intervals.icu API key

3. **Test the workflow**:
   - Go to Actions tab in your GitHub repository
   - Select "Daily AI Fitness Coaching"
   - Click "Run workflow" to test manually
   - Check the logs to ensure it runs successfully

4. **Customize schedule**:
   - Modify the cron expression in the workflow file
   - Use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) to generate custom schedules
   - Remember GitHub Actions uses UTC time

#### Option 2: Local Cron Job

**Advantages**: Full control, no external dependencies, immediate execution.

```bash
# Edit your crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line to run every day at 8 AM local time
0 8 * * * cd /path/to/your/fitness/project && node index.js >> ~/coaching.log 2>&1
```

#### Timezone Considerations

- **GitHub Actions**: Runs in UTC timezone
- **Local Cron**: Uses your system's timezone
- Adjust the cron schedule accordingly for your preferred coaching time

└── README.md
```

## Athlete Profile

The coach is configured for an athlete profile defined in `config.js`:

```javascript
const athleteProfile = {
  age: 41,
  weight: 78,
  cycling_ftp: 250,
  running_threshold: "4:52", // min/km
  max_hr: 190,
  rhr: 49, // resting heart rate
  hrv: 80, // heart rate variability baseline
};
```

Modify these values to match your personal metrics.

## Coaching Philosophy

The AI coach implements **Stephen Seiler's Polarized Training Model**:

- **80/20 Rule**: 80% low intensity (Zone 1), 20% high intensity (Zone 3+)
- **Black Hole Training**: Warns against excessive Zone 2 (moderate intensity)
- **Efficiency Factor**: Monitors power-to-heart-rate ratio trends
- **Recovery Priority**: Overrides training when HRV/RHR indicate poor recovery
- **Plateau Detection**: Identifies when fitness gains have stagnated

## Sample Output

The AI coach posts structured analysis to your calendar:

```
---

**Wednesday, February 25, 2026**

**Readiness Score:** 7/10

**Readiness Description:**
You are in a recovery phase following a high-load week. HRV is stable, and RHR is within baseline, but yesterday's low training load and recent fatigue accumulation suggest a need for continued recovery focus. Today is about maintaining movement without adding stress.

---

## Yesterday Session Analysis

**Session:** Easy Ride (2026-02-24)
- **Duration:** 1h00m
- **TSS:** 30, **IF:** 0.54
- **Time in Zones:** Z1: 53.6%, Z2: 45.3%, Z3: 1.1%
- **Efficiency Factor (EF):** 1.12, **Power/HR:** 1.09
- **Decoupling:** 6.3%

**Compliance:**
- The session was appropriately easy, with 98.9% of the ride in Z1-Z2, aligning well with polarized training principles. No "black hole" training detected.

---

## The Problem

- **Fatigue Accumulation:** ATL (Acute Training Load) remains elevated at 44, despite a planned recovery day. This suggests residual fatigue from the previous week's high volume.
- **HRV Stability:** HRV is within normal range (84 ms), but the trend shows fluctuation over the past week, indicating some autonomic stress.
- **Reduced Training Load:** Yesterday's TSS of 30 is low, but the lack of complete rest days in the last two weeks may be contributing to lingering fatigue.
- **Sleep Quality:** Sleep score has been variable, with a dip to 70 on 2026-02-21, which may have impacted recovery.

---

## The Prescription

- **Today's Workout:**
  - **Session:** Z1 Recovery Run
  - **Duration:** 45-60 minutes
  - **Intensity:** Strictly Z1 (<138 bpm, <75% Max HR)
  - **Focus:** Maintain easy pace, prioritize form, and avoid any surges into Z2. This is about active recovery, not fitness gains.

- **Recovery Actions:**
  - **Sleep:** Aim for >8 hours. Monitor sleep quality and consistency.
  - **Nutrition:** Ensure adequate carbohydrate intake to replenish glycogen stores, and prioritize protein for muscle repair.
  - **Hydration:** Maintain hydration levels, especially given the indoor training sessions.

- **Next 48hrs:**
  - **Monitor HRV/RHR:** If HRV drops >10% below your 7-day average or RHR rises >5 bpm, take an unplanned rest day.
  - **Avoid Intensity:** No Z3+ efforts until ATL drops below 40 and HRV stabilizes above 85 ms.
  - **Mobility Work:** Incorporate 10-15 minutes of daily mobility/stretching to aid recovery.

## API Integration

### Intervals.icu Endpoints Used

- `GET /athlete/{id}/activities` - Fetch workout history
- `GET /athlete/{id}/wellness/{date}` - Get daily wellness metrics
- `POST /athlete/{id}/events` - Create calendar events with coaching notes

### Mistral AI Integration

- **Agent Creation**: Custom coaching agent with specialized instructions
- **Conversation API**: Processes training data and generates analysis
- **Model**: Uses `mistral-large-latest` for comprehensive analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No wellness data found"**

- Check that you're logging HRV, sleep, or other wellness metrics in intervals.icu
- Ensure the date format matches your timezone

**"API authentication failed"**

- Verify your intervals.icu API key in Settings → Developer
- Check that ATHLETE_ID matches your intervals.icu URL

**"Mistral API error"**

- Confirm your Mistral API key is valid and has credits
- Check the Mistral API status page for outages

### Debug Mode

Add debugging to see detailed API responses:

```javascript
console.log("Debug data:", JSON.stringify(response, null, 2));
```

## Development

### Adding New Metrics

To track additional wellness metrics, modify the `fetchFullData()` function in `intervals/wellness.js`:

```javascript
const additionalMetrics = {
  bodyFat: wellness.bodyFat,
  vo2max: wellness.vo2max,
  // Add other metrics from intervals.icu API
};
```

### Customizing Coaching Style

Edit the agent instructions in `getOrCreateAgent()` to modify:

- Feedback tone (currently blunt/scientific)
- Training philosophy
- Analysis focus areas
- Output formatting
